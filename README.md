👋 Hi, I’m Grégoire Sarsat (@GregDataMiner)
🎓 I’m a Master's student in Risk Assurance and Financial Risk Management at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.
👀 Passionate about data analysis, financial modeling, and machine learning, I thrive on tackling complex problems with innovative solutions.
💻 My skills include:

Programming & Tools: Python, R, VBA, Stata
Expertise: Risk modeling (VaR, CVaR), stress testing, econometrics, and financial analysis

🌱 Currently learning advanced techniques in machine learning and expanding my expertise in actuarial science.
💼 Actively looking for a 6-month internship starting March 2025, where I can leverage my skills to drive value in risk management or data analytics projects.
