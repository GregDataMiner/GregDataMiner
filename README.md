👋 Hi, I’m Grégoire 
🎓 I’m a Master's student in Risk Assurance and Financial Risk Management at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.
👀 Passionate about data financial analysis and modeling, machine learning, I thrive on tackling complex problems with innovative solutions.
💻 My skills include:

Programming & Tools: Python, R, VBA, Stata

🌱 Currently learning advanced techniques in machine learning and expanding my expertise in actuarial science.
